"""Domestic violence refers to a pattern of behaviors used by one person in a relationship to gain power and control over another person. It can take various forms, including physical, emotional, psychological, sexual, and financial abuse. Reporting cases of domestic violence is crucial as it helps victims receive the support they need, ensures their safety, and holds perpetrators accountable for their actions. By reporting domestic violence, we contribute to breaking the cycle of abuse, protecting vulnerable individuals, and promoting healthier relationships within our communities.""",
